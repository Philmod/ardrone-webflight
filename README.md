# ardrone-webflight

Pilot the AR.Drone 2.0 directly from your browser. Extend the application with plugins
to add features such as video recording, autonomous flight, face recognition, and more.
It makes it a very friendly environment to quickly build and experiment with your drone 
(e.g. during a nodecopter event).

If you encounter an issue; please submit it to the issue tracker! You can also catch
up with me (eschnou) on twitter or on #freenode (channel #nodecopter).

**This branch is the development branch, there are no packaged release yet.** 

## Built-in plugins

* **[video-png](plugins/video-png/)** stream the video to the browser through static image loading, 
    works great in every browser.

* **[video-stream](plugins/video-stream/)** use [node-dronestream](https://github.com/bkw/node-dronestream) to stream the raw h264 video 
feed via webscokets and rendering in Javascript !!! Need a modern browser and CPU.

* **[hud](plugins/hud/)** to visualize a head-up display with artificial horizon, compass, 
    altimeter, etc. Based on [nodecopter-cockpit](https://github.com/bkw/nodecopter-cockpit)

* **[pilot](plugins/pilot)** to control the drone remotely using the keyboard. Based on [drone-browser](https://github.com/functino/drone-browser).

* **[picture](plugins/picture)** to save a picture to the server, from the browser.

* **[video-png_face-detection](plugins/video-png_face-detection/)** same as video-png, with face detection (use open-cv).

## Install

WebFlight requires a recent nodejs (built and tested with node > 0.10) as well as
[npm](https://npmjs.org/) and [bower](http://bower.io/) for dependency management.

```
git clone git@github.com:eschnou/ardrone-webflight
cd ardrone-webflight
npm install
bower install
```

## Usage

1. Copy the config.js.sample to config.js and edit to select your plugins
2. Connect to the drone's wifi
3. Run `node app.js`
4. Point your browser to http://localhost:3000/

If you have enabled the **pilot** plugin, you can fly the drone with the following keys. Yes, 
these are azerty bindings :-) If you need qwerty ones, just change the parameter `keyboardType` in the plugin. I'll need to find 
a way to provide custome configuration etc.

Use `Z, S, Q, D` to move front, back and sideways. Use your `cursors` to go up/down or turn 
clockwise/counter clockwise. Use `t` to takeoff and `l` for landing.

## Adding your own plugin

There is no tutorial yet, in the meanwhile, just have a look at the built in plugins, 
it is faily straightforward. 

I would like to maintain a list of user plugins. If you hack something, please let me know
and I'll add you to the list.

## Thanks

This work is based on the integration of [nodecopter-cockpit](https://github.com/bkw/nodecopter-cockpit) 
and [drone-browser](https://github.com/functino/drone-browser), refactored in a plugin architecture.
Thanks to [@bkw](https://github.com/bkw/) and [@functino](https://github.com/functino) for sharing! Also 
a big thank you to [@felixge](https://github.com/felixge) for his [node-ar-drone](https://github.com/felixge/node-ar-drone) library 
which pushed me into buying a drone and become crazy about these little flying robots!
